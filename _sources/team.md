He holds a B.Sc. in Behavioural Neuroscience from the University of British Columbia and has conducted research across multiple institutions, including OIST (Okinawa, Japan) and ICORD (UBC, Vancouver, British Columbia). Recently, he has been working with members of Enigma to test and quality assess the use of HALFpipe, and develop an easy-to-use codebase to evaluate denoising strategies applied by HALFpipe. He is particularly interested in big data approaches to neuroscience, integrating information-theoretic approaches and multimodal data to improve decoding of mental states, as well as machine learning applications for biomarker discovery in psychiatric disease. Outside of the lab, Seann loves to play music, traveling, and enjoying Montreal's beautiful sunny days."""
